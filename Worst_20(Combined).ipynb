       " 'We wore KEP for our wedding and unfortunately the experience we had was overall stressful and disappointing. We would not recommend KEP to anyone that has a strict deadline and/or anyone who expects a high level of customer service. After receiving a few recommendations from friends, my now husband and I made an appointment in the NYC store on May 10 looking for white jackets and black pants (for made to measure) for our wedding on the west coast on August 20 (so, at least 3 months in advance). After a LOT of back and forth (finding white vs. cream fabric is a lot more difficult than it sounds) we finally found fabric that we wanted and on May 24 went through the entire process of getting measured and paying a lot of money (thousands of dollars each) for the outfits. Since KEP was a well-known brand, especially in the gay community, we were excited about our decision to splurge a little bit on this, with the expectation that the service would be great and that this would be something we didn’t need to stress out about last-minute. We were very wrong. Fast forward a month later, on June 21, we received a call from KEP saying that they actually didn’t have enough of the white fabric we chose to make two jackets, and there wasn’t enough time to wait until they received more in stock. So they said we should come back in to pick a different fabric. Since we already paid and already got measured and frankly didn’t have enough time to go elsewhere, we rushed into the store to pick a different fabric. The new fabric we chose cost more than our original, and given the situation KEP offered it to us at no additional charge. We felt like things were back on track and looked forward to our fitting a few weeks before the wedding to make any last-minute adjustments. More time goes by, and then we hear from KEP saying that they need to push our fitting from a few weeks before the wedding to 10 days before the wedding. We became more nervous, especially because we had planned for KEP to ship the outfits to the west coast so we wouldn’t have to travel with them. Then, when that date approached, KEP said we would have to push it to 8 days before the wedding (the Friday before). We became more nervous. When we came to the fitting, we learned that only the jackets were ready, and not the pants. The jackets needed adjustments. We asked when the pants would be ready for us to try on and they said they would let us know ASAP. The entire weekend went by and we did not hear anything from them. We called, messaged, and texted just about everyone we could find who works at the company and heard nothing until Monday morning (5 days before the wedding), when they said that everything is fine and that they are shipping our pants directly to the west coast. This obviously made us extremely nervous because this meant that we wouldn’t be able to trying our pants on prior to the wedding. We asked them to ship the pants to the west coast as soon as possible so we could get them tailored there if necessary. Miray (the co-founder of KEP), instead of apologizing for the last-minute scramble and rushing, reminded us how they have been good partners and assured us that the pants would be fine and that we had nothing to worry about. The pants arrived on the west coast 3 days before the wedding and they were, as expected, too big. In the midst of everything else going on, we had to rush a tailoring job (through a tailor we found on our own) and paid $90 to fix the pants. We picked up the pants the morning of the wedding.The thing that bothered us most was not the fact that our outfits arrived behind schedule. It was the extreme lack of service we experienced throughout the entire process. Communicating with the co-founder of the company, as well as the NYC representative, was always terribly painful. There was a lack of responsiveness, a lack of answers, and a lack of urgency. For a high-end store, we found the service to be seriously disappointing. Having to deal with last-minute adjustments before your wedding (among everything else) is one of the most stressful experiences in itself, but the feeling of having to deal with it alone, without the support of the company you just paid thousands of dollars to, is the highest insult. No one from KEP ever apologized for this experience, instead saying that they understand weddings can be stressful.After the wedding, we emailed Miray asking if they could reimburse us for the $90 rush tailoring. She did not respond. I followed up and said that we were planning to write reviews of all of our wedding vendors online. She did not respond.',\n",

They sent me a shipping label that I brought, along with the ship, to The UPS Store. As with any Amazon return, they said they would take care of sending it back.A few days later, I was given a $60 refund. When I inquired about the replacement ship, I was told by The History Store that they would not be sending one. They claimed that the product was not packaged correctly for return and could no longer be sold as new. Because of this, they charged me a $90 restocking fee and refunded the remaining $60.Amazon reached out to the seller on my behalf to explain the situation and request that the full amount be refunded.

       " 'I purchased a Sierra Designs Flex Capacitor 40-60L backpack from Campsaver.com, and I had a rewarding experience. I placed my order on a Wednesday and received the backpack the following Tuesday. I was extremely pleased with the fast processing and shipping. Better yet, the customer service was terrific. The reps I spoke with were helpful, professional and friendly, and they were not pushy at all. I highly recommend Campsaver.com.',\n",
       " 'One of the top 3 worst shopping experiences ever, not worth even one star. Placed order and paid when there were a couple dozens of items in stock, 4 days later I hear back saying my order was cancelled because the product is not available.',\n",
       " \"Ordered a pair of climbing shoes, but they turned out to be a tad too big.  No prob, shipped back to Campsaver on their own dime.  Got another pair and too small.  You guessed it, sent back again at their cost.  Received pair #3 (again at campsaver.com's cost) and they are perfect!  So easy to deal with, great prices, and exceptional return/exchange policies.  One really can't ask for more.\",\n",
       " \"I had terrific customer service. Ordered last weekend. My order arrived today (total 6 days). I think people who commented in recent months didn't take into account the problem with the USPS. I saved $73 per pair of shoes which is substantial. There was a glitch with the website so I ended up ordering over the phone and the people at Campsaver couldn't have been nicer.\",\n",
       " \"I ordered an item December 1 for a Christmas present and to date it has only ever shown as in process. That's 17 days so far without any progress and I have called customer service every day this week. They only tell me that they have tried escalating my order assuring me that it is not a back order issue they are simply that back logged. I will never do business with this company again.\",\n",
       " 'I ordered a tent in august and it had not yet delivered.  They keep moving the delivery date and when I contacted them, they said\"you can cancel the order at anytime\"....  an incredible disrespectful approach to doing business...  I won\\'t cancel my order and I am waiting to see how long it will take for them to deliver my purchase. So far almost 5 months.  My order number is Order #16175318',\n",
       " 'Trash Company, avoid like the plague. Ordered a bike box with express shipping (~$290 + $60 shipping), 8 working days later and they are still \"processing\" the order. If you can\\'t fulfill customer orders, don\\'t accept payment for so many...there are plenty of competitors out there who will do a much better job & happily take the business you are clearly unable to handle.',\n",
       " 'Placed an order which was shipped via UPS - order was over $1600.00.  Received a confirmation that it was delivered, though it never was.  Campsaver would NOT return emails, so I disputed the charge with my credit card.  Two months later, it arrives.  Campsaver instantly contacted me for their money.  Communication is terrible, order process was terrible.  I would NEVER place an order with this company again.',\n",
       " 'Do not buy from campsaver.com.   They sent me the wrong item, twice, and I only ordered one item.  If I had to wait for a backorder, it would be another 2 months before I seen the item I ordered, and camping season will be over by then.  I should charge them interest for holding onto my money.  Fortunately for them, the lowest rating I can give them is one star, they actually deserve a negative 5 star review.',\n",
       " 'This was not a good experience.  I made a large several item order.   No acknowledgement.  Three weeks later, I received one item that was marked irregular.  When I eventually got a hold of customer service, which was in and of itself a challenge, they said they would precess a return, but I have heard nothing.  Camp savers is not a legit site.  Beware.',\n",
       " 'The site promises a 5-10 day delivery window. It has been 1 Month and still no delivery or communication regarding the delay. Speaking of communication, Campsaver communication is horrible. It is next to impossible to get up with them because when you call an automatic response tells you that \"they are not currently taking calls...\" and when you e-mail you get no response.']"
